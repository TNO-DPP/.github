# Digital Product Passports

## Introduction

Welcome to TNO's Digital Product Passport repository! This project aims at co-ordinating efforts around standardization for Digital Product Passports, which provide a comprehensive way to document and share information about digital products. We identify some gaps in existing implementations surrounding Digital Product Passports, which we try to address from the perspective of adopters across various contexts and industries. Our vision of a generic Digital Product Passport infrastructure spans as many use-cases as possible, and tries to stay agnostic of normative standards, while covering perspectives of significant interest.

## Getting Started

To begin, it may be quite useful to look at our documentation repository, addressing many of the adoption considerations for Digital Product Passports. The use-cases repositories we provide are similarly interesting to identify how we put together many of the complex technologies involved in this domain. This project is still a work-in-progress, and we will add the missing repositories as soon as we can!
